<h1>Table cameras for this century</h1>

<p>
	Camera technology has come a long way since the modern disposable table camera was introduced in 1986.<br>
	Despite these advances, disposable table cameras have barely evolved over the past 30 years.
</p>

<p>
	That's where we come in!<br>
	We provide high-quality digital point-and-shoot table cameras for your guests to use during your event.
